 “If you’re not falling on your face, you’re not leaning far enough forward to take risks.”

If there's no enemy within, the enemy outside can do us no harm.

One minute of anger robbs you of 60 secs of happiness

Unavoidable suffering.

If you can see it in your mind you can hold it in your hand

Tell me I can't do it and I prove you wrong.
